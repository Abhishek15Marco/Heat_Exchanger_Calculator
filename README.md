# Heat_Exchanger_Calculator
This project is a Python-based calculator for analyzing the performance of heat exchangers. It allows users to compute heat load, LMTD (Log Mean Temperature Difference), and area requirements, while comparing counter-flow and parallel-flow configurations.

Features
Calculates heat load for hot and cold streams.
Computes LMTD for accurate thermal performance evaluation.
Estimates heat exchanger area requirements.
Supports both Counter-flow and Parallel-flow heat exchangers.
Provides Matplotlib visualizations for better interpretation of results.

Technologies Used
Python
Matplotlib (for plotting results)
NumPy (for numerical calculations)
